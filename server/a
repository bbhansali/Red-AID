It is a web app useful for blood donors who can donate blood and receive it back if they need it in the
future.
This would encourage users to donate blood regularly and solve the current needs of the people.
our idea is to build an integrated system that will bring donors and blood bank associations under one
roof. we intend to build a software application that both the user and the
blood bank association can use to keep track and manage the inventory.
on the user's side, whenever he wishes to donate blood, he can locate all blood banks near him and
visit any to make the donation. the user is verified using valid identity proof
like aadhar card. the donation made by the users is updated in his profile, and also in the blood bank
association's inventory. the user is also scored for his/her
regularity in blood donation.
when the user requires blood, he/she can make a request to the nearest blood bank based on the
units they have donated and their score, to receive blood for free or
at minimum cost, by providing valid documentation.
this would facilitate more users to donate blood and as it would be beneficial for them in the future.
On the blood bank's side, their job is to verify the user's identify before taking/giving blood and update
the inventory.
Maintenance of inventory will help curb the illegal activities.
